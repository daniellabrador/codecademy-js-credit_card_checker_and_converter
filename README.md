## Projects

The Codecademy course that I took explains the JavaScript fundamentals a programmer needs for front-end or back-end development. The following are the projects accomplished during the whole duration of my study as well as their respective prompts/problems:

1. **[Credit Card Checker](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/credit-card-checker-challenge-project-javascript/462375) (in progress)**: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

## Technologies

- JavaScript ES6
