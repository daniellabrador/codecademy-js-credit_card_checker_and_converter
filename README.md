# **Credit Card Checker and Converter**

This program checks if a credit card number is valid or not, as well as convert invalid credit card numbers to valid ones. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my problem-solving skills and my knowledge with JavaScript loops.

## Project Prompt

The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the [verification process](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/credit-card-checker/diagrams/cc%20validator%20diagram%201.svg) using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. You can go further and write a program that will convert invalid credit card numbers to valid credit card numbers. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

## Technologies

- JavaScript ES6

## Setup

To run this program, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or any other ways to see output of [main.js](main.js) to the console.

- To check if a credit card number is valid, use the validateCred() function and enter a string, a number or an array of numbers as its argument.
- To get an array of invalid card numbers among an array of random card numbers, use the findInvalidCards() function and enter an array of cards as its argument.
- To identify the credit card companies that supposedly issued the cards, use the idInvalidCardCompanies() function and enter an array of invalid cards as its argument.
- To convert invalid credit card numbers, use the testConversion() function and enter a string, a number or an array of numbers as its argument.
